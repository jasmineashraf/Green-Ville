<h1 align="center"> Greek Salad </h1>

<br>
<p>A traditional Greek salad consists of sliced cucumbers, tomatoes, green bell pepper, red onion,olives and feta cheese.My olives of choice are Kalamata olives. Commonly used in Greek food,</p> 
<p>their salty, briny flavoris delectable alongside the feta and crisp veggies.Instead of slicing large tomatoes, I use cherry tomatoes because they release less water into the salad</p>
<p>than larger tomatoes would. I also seed my cucumber to avoid making my salad watery.</p>
<p>A great salad will have a yummy jumble of veggies, olives, and cheese in each bite, so be sure to cut your ingredients 
<p>into similar-sized pieces. I like to buy pitted Kalamata olives and leave them whole, and I chop the feta into 1/2-inch cubes instead of crumbling it.</p>
<p>I aim for 1-inch squares for the bell pepper, cut the cucumber into thin half-moons, and simply halve the cherry tomatoes.</p>
<h2 align="center">Greek Salad dressing</h2>
<p>I toss the veggies, olives, and feta cheese in an easy homemade Greek salad dressing. With just 5 ingredients + salt and pepper,</p>
<p>it’s super simple to whisk together, and it gives this easy Greek salad recipe a bright, zingy flavor. It’s a simple mix of olive oil, red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, garlic, and dried oregano.</p>
<p>In addition to using them in the dressing, I like to sprinkle my salad with generous pinches of oregano and black pepper for a fresh, peppery garnish.</p>
<h1 align="center"> Tuna Salad</h1>

<p>The first step to any salad is to start with the dressing. That way, when all the other parts of the salad are ready you can immediately toss on the dressing.For the Lemon Vinaigrette </p>
<p>you can either toss everything in a food processor or if you mince the shallot fine enough, you can just shake it all up in a jar. Here are the ingredients needed for it:</p>

<p>We all need a good green salad recipe in our back pocket…which is why I can’t believe that in almost 10(!) years of blogging, I haven’t shared a simple green salad until today.</p> 
<p>That’s not to say that there’s a shortage of salad recipes on the site (broccoli salad, pasta salad, or avocado salad, anyone?).But it has been missing a quick,</p>
<p>refreshing salad that you can toss together at the last minute and serve with almost anything.Well, let me introduce you to my favorite green salad recipe.</p>
<p>It’s simple, but it doesn’t skimp at all on texture or flavor. I toss in avocado for creamy richness, Parmesan cheese for nutty, salty flavor,</p>
<p>and tamari roasted almonds for crunch.To bring it all together, I drizzle on my go-to lemon vinaigrette. It makes this salad zingy,bright,</p> 
<p>and oh-so-versatile. It pairs just as nicely with pasta as it does with a veggie burger, and it tastes great with classic brunch fare too.</p> 
<p>If you need a last-minute side dish to round out your Easter menu this weekend, this green salad would be perfect.</p>
<p>Great green salad recipes start with great greens. Though I love a good kale salad or mixed greens salad as much as</p>
<p>the next person, when I’m making a simple, refreshing side salad, I like to use lettuce as the base.Look for lettuces that have soft leaves</p>
<p>and crisp stems with no discoloration. I especially like the flavor and texture of Butter lettuces like Boston and Bibb, but tender leaf</p>
<p>or romaine lettuce would work well here too. Use whatever looks best. The more varieties, the merrier!</p>
<p>When you’re ready to make the salad, pull the lettuce leaves apart, and wash and dry them well.</p> 
<p>To avoid bruising or tearing the leaves, I recommend using a salad spinner for this step (I have this one)</p> 
<p>With it, you’ll be able to get the leaves almost perfectly dry in no time!</p>
<h2 align="center">Green Salad dressing</h2>
<p>In a small bowl, whisk together the mustard, garlic, vinegar, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. While whisking, slowly add the olive oil until the vinaigrette is emulsified.</p>
<p>Place the salad greens in a medium bowl and add enough dressing to moisten. Sprinkle with a little extra salt and pepper, if desired, and serve immediately.</p>
<h1 align="center"> Caesar Salad</h1>
<img src="salad4.png" alt="salad4" hight="250px" width="250px" class="center">
<br>
<br>
<p>Do a little research into the background of the Caesar salad and you'll find that it is named not for some illustrious Roman emperor, but for Caesar Cardini, a Mexican chef working</p>
<p>in Tijuana in the 1920s, who dramatically served it up table-side. (At least that's how the story goes.)</p>
<p>Fast forward to this century and you have what is probably the most popular restaurant salad in America, with plenty of variations around the theme of romaine lettuce, garlic,</p>
<p>Parmesan, and croutons.</p>
<p>In this recipe we are making croutons from scratch, from baguette slices that have been brushed with olive oil, toasted, and then roughly chopped. You toast the baguette slices</p> 
<p>while the garlic soaks in olive oil in the serving bowl, which a great way to infuse the oil with garlic.</p>
<h2 align="center">Caesar Salad dressing</h2>
<p>Classic Caesar Salad dressing is made with olive oil, garlic, raw eggs, and anchovies. The eggs give the dressing creaminess, and the anchovies? A salty, savory deliciousness.</p> 
<p>If you don't have access to anchovies, just add a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce to the dressing.</p>
